I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out
the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man
who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me,
and then look back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could
only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very
wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had
dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all
my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back
so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had
regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than
Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face
half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.

"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"

"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness to
get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
you."

"I have a cab outside."

"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into
any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you
have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."

"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine
injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
views."
