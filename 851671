We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the
road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in,
and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to
the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a
dream.
