"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are without looking." Then,
suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear
and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried,
"else how could you know all that?"

"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained
myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"

"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when
the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for
me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make
by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips
together and his eyes to the ceiling.
