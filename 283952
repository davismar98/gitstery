"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as
requested.

"What, then?"

"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she
was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened
eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but
her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran
her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.

"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. "We shall soon set
matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."
