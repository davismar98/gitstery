"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have
elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that
this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had
begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which
it had come upon my father."

The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out
upon it five little dried orange pips.

"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is London--eastern division. Within are the very
words which were upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the papers on the
sundial.'"
