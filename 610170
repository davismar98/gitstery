"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your
Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business
to a more successful conclusion."

"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be more successful. I know that her
word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
