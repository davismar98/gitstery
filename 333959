"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so
vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another,

oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey."

Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.
