For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our
visitor's knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon
the white wrist.

"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.

The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He is a hard man," she said, "and
perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."

There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the
crackling fire.
