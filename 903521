"How did you deduce the select?"

"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one
of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second
one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H.
Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries
against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to
be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the
loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it
would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the
general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you
see, I made him keep the appointment."

"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was certainly not very gracious."
