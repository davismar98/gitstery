"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in
China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the
subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.
When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more
simple."

Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done
something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all."
