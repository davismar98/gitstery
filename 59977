Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. "I have
been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned out
splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."

"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, and in a few words he
sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.

"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."

"So it appears."

"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?"
