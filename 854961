"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in
China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the

When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more
simple."

"Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."
