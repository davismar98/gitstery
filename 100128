Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading
the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the
plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the
corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and
eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the
sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.

"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie
down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired
and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."

"Thank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think
that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as
possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences."

Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and
eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our
visitor detailed to us.
