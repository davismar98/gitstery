"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand that
he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor
customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."

"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt of it. But have you never been
prosecuted for begging?"

"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"

"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are to hush this thing up, there must
be no more of Hugh Boone."

"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."
