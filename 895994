"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of
the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to
you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--
one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and
attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man
who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.

"'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.'

"'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.

"'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have £50,000 at once. I could, of
course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a
matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand
that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations.'

"'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.

"'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance,
with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money
should be paid at once.'
