not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very
best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long
journey. I have seen young McCarthy."

"And what did you learn from him?"

"Nothing."

"Could he throw no light?"

"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him
or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted
youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart."
