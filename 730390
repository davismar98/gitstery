"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was accustomed to use slang of the kind.
I have no idea what she meant."

"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished speaking
to her maid?"

"She walked into the breakfast-room."

"On your arm?"

"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for
ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never
came back."
