We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run
out to the horse's head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive
which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the
opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her
neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the
door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with
eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.

"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which
sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.

"No good news?"

"None."
