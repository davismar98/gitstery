"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how
the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the
most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within
my experience."

"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have
been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond
that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the
very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."
