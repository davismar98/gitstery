"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued.
"I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation
to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters
which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the
'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens,
that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."

Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort of
fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you
have done it."
