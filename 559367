"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."

"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a
peaked cap and frogged jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet." "Certainly, Mr.
Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the
table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.

"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"

"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the
disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee."

"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."
