"And sit in the dark?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie
carr√©e, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so
far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions.
These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm
unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those.
Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction
about shooting them down."

I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot
the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness
as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was
still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of
expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank
air of the vault.
