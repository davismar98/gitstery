I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a
suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his
hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not
more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale
and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all
his strength of mind to control.

"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I have had a very serious accident
during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I
might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see
that she has left it upon the side-table."

I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd
floor)." That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have kept you
waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You are fresh from a night journey, I
understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation."

"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with
a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose
up against that laugh.
