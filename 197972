"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and
refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a
small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he
came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting
a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the
little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we
entered, so that he might have a private word with us.

"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'

"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot recall
when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed
at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and
congratulated me warmly on my success.
