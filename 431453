The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a
sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled
gaze.

"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by
the 5.15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent."

"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean that she has
left England?"

"Never to return."
