"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."

"Dark enough and sinister enough."

"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door,
window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met
her mysterious end."

"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying
woman?"

"I cannot think."

"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on
intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor
has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and,
finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one
of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is
good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."
