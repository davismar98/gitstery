Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. "I have
been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned out
splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."

"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, and in a few words he
sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.

"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."

"So it appears."

"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?"

"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his
track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your
aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms
which we are to examine."
