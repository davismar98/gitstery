Dear Mr. Holmes: I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a
situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do
not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully, Violet Hunter.

"Do you know the young lady?" I asked.

"Not I."
