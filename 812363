"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have touched on three English counties in
our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See
that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears
have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."

"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I asked.

"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put
two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my
friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband. Here we are.
Whoa, there, whoa!"
