"How are you getting on?"

"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not
call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good
deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return
to my highly respectable self."

I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would
imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened
upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off
once more upon his congenial hunt.

I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no
uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that
his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to
breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other,
as fresh and trim as possible.
