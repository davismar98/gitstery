"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.

"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about
it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured,
but the reward offered of Â£1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price."

"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared
from one to the other of us.

"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the
background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover
the gem."
