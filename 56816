The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad,
with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in
his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He
looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his
eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.

"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. "I trust that I am not
intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber."

"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest here on the hook and will be dry
presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see."

"Yes, from Horsham."

"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive."
