"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes,
as though his question was already answered.

"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It is so. I know all about McCarthy."

The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried. "But I would not have let the young
man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the
Assizes."

"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.

"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will break
her heart when she hears that I am arrested."
