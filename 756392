"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in
Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could
get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about
him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my
confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I
thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be seized
and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at
the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came
into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.

"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas
present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I
would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of
the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I
thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt
the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped and struggled, and
out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose
and fluttered off among the others.

"'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.
