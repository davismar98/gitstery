He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a
commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat
brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the
dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as
a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his
hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.

"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is looking up at the numbers of the
houses."

"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his hands.

"Here?"

"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the
symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and
pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.

A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look
of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For a
while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has
been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his
head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre
of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his
hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
