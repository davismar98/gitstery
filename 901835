"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back.
Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the
hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are
likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the
repairs, you could manage there for one night."

"Oh, yes, easily."

"The rest you will leave in our hands."

"But what will you do?"

"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has
disturbed you."
