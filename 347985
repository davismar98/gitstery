"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me
that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge
sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a
meaning to it."

"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to
him?"

"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I
think that what he foresaw happened."

"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"

"None."
