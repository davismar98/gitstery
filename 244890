was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it,
or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as
death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it,
was missing.

"'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have destroyed it! You have dishonoured
me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?'

"'Stolen!' he cried.

"'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.

"'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.
