"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door
was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a
tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this
fashion:

The Red-headed League          is       Dissolved   October 9, 1890.

Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the
comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out
into a roar of laughter.

"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his
flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really
wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will
excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you
found the card upon the door?"
