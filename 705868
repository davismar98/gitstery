"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting than her
little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you
consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old
as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself
was most instructive."

"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.

"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was
important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-
nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that
woman's appearance? Describe it."

"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her
jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her
dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and
sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't
observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in
a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."

Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
