"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the
love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle
of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before
as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and
retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still
flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own
family.

"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer
to Sir George's house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master
had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by
buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they
exactly fitted the tracks."

"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening," said Mr. Holder.
