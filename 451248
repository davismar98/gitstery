One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to
announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed
hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs.
As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.

"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he's all right."

"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had
caged up in my room.

"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip
away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as
you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.

I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a
suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his
hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not
more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale
and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all
his strength of mind to control.

"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I have had a very serious accident
during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I
might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see
that she has left it upon the side-table."
