"Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You have already
imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit
down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"

The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his
face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,
began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for
he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.
